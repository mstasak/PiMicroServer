- Raspberry Pi 3B, with power supply, heatsinks, and enclosure.
- 512 GB 2.5" SATA SSD (Silicon Power), USB drive enclosure
- Typical USB KB, USB Mouse, small FHD Monitor

Note you may need a powered drive enclosure, or a powered USB hub, if your drive demands too much power.  2.5" SDD drives generally run OK off the Pi's power delivered over the USB cable.
